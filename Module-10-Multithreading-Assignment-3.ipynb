    "# Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Multithreading in Python:\n",
    "-   Multithreading is a technique that allows a program to execute multiple threads concurrently within a single process.\n",
    "-   A thread is a lightweight unit of execution that shares the same memory space as other threads within the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it is used:\n",
    "-   Improved Performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of applications by utilizing multiple CPU cores and reducing the time spent waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
    "-   Increased Responsiveness: It can make applications more responsive by allowing them to continue executing other tasks while waiting for long-running operations.\n",
    "-   Better Resource Utilization: Multithreading can help in better utilization of system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module used:\n",
    "-   The 'threading' module in Python is used to handle threads.\n",

    "#    2. currentThread()\n",
    "#    3. enumerate()\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Why threading module is used:\n",
    "The 'threading' module provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads in Python. It simplifies the process of working with threads, allowing developers to easily create concurrent applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions of the threading module:\n",
    "1.  activeCount():\n",
    "    -   Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "    -   Syntax: threading.activeCount()\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  currentThread():\n",
    "    -   Returns the current Thread object, corresponding to the caller's thread of execution.\n",
    "    -   Syntax: threading.currentThread() or threading.current_thread()\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  enumerate():\n",

    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Explanation of threading functions:\n",
    "1.  run():\n",
    "    -   The 'run()' method is the entry point for a thread's activity.\n",
    "    -   It defines the code that the thread will execute when it is started.\n",
    "    -   This method should be overridden in a subclass of Thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  start():\n",
    "    -   The 'start()' method starts a new thread of execution.\n",
    "    -   It calls the 'run()' method of the thread, which begins the thread's activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  join():\n",
    "    -   The 'join()' method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution.\n",
    "    -   When one thread calls 'join()' on another thread, the calling thread blocks until the other thread finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  isAlive():\n",
    "    -   The 'isAlive()' method checks whether a thread is currently executing.\n",
    "    -   It returns True if the thread is alive (i.e., it has been started and has not yet finished), and False otherwise.\n",

    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "-   Increased Performance: By utilizing multiple CPU cores, multithreading can speed up the execution of tasks.\n",
    "-   Improved Responsiveness: Applications can remain responsive to user input even while performing long-running operations.\n",
    "-   Better Resource Utilization: Multithreading allows for more efficient use of system resources.\n",
    "-   Concurrency: Enables concurrent execution of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "-   Complexity: Multithreaded programming can be more complex than single-threaded programming, leading to potential issues like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "-   Synchronization Overhead: Coordinating between threads requires synchronization mechanisms (like locks), which can introduce overhead.\n",
    "-   Debugging Difficulty: Debugging multithreaded applications can be more challenging due to the non-deterministic nature of thread execution.\n",
    "-   Increased Memory Usage: Each thread requires its own stack space, which can increase memory consumption.\n",
    "-   Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python: In CPython, the GIL can limit the actual concurrency of CPU-bound threads.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "-   A deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources that they need.\n",
    "-   It occurs when the following four conditions are met simultaneously:\n",
    "    1.  Mutual Exclusion: Threads have exclusive access to the resources they require.\n",
    "    2.  Hold and Wait: Threads hold resources while waiting for additional resources.\n",
    "    3.  No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread; they can only be released voluntarily.\n",
    "    4.  Circular Wait: A circular chain of threads exists, where each thread is waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "-   A race condition is a situation in which the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads.\n",
    "-   It occurs when two or more threads access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the threads access the data.\n",
    "-   Race conditions can lead to unpredictable and erroneous results, as the order of execution can vary each time the program is run.\n",
